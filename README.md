# Functional Programming
This is where I keep my Functional Programming projects (LISP/Scheme/Racket etc.)
Each project in placed in a corresponding directory.

## [Monty Hall](https://github.com/Gariben/Functional/tree/master/Monty_Hall/Racket/current)
This is a simulation of the Monty Hall Problem written in Racket.

* Written in **Racket**.
* Compiled in **Dr. Racket**.
* Requires rackunit depedency for checking. (These check-equal statements can be commented out).

## [Neural Network](https://github.com/Gariben/Functional/tree/master/Neural_Network)
\*\*WORK IN PROGRESS\*\*
This (will be) a program that generates a trainable neural network given a topology.
Inspired by the lessons in Neural Network Design by Martin T. Hagan et al.

* Written in **Racket**.
* Compiled in **Dr. Racket**.
* Requires rackunit depedency for checking. (These check-equal statements can be commented out).
